> **About the author** — I am not a professional developer, but I work in IT with a solid understanding of software development. This project was built through **vibe coding** with AI assistance (**Claude Sonnet 4.6** and **Gemini Pro**), which allowed me to ship this app despite having no prior native Android experience. The code reflects that approach: functional and goal-oriented, but with room for improvement. **Expert contributions are very welcome** — whether it's bug fixes, code review, or broader improvements to the app. Version history is available in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kiroha/byd-dashcast/releases).

## WindowManagement v1.2 — Reverse Engineering

`WindowManagement v1.2` is a third-party app used on DiLink systems to control the cluster
display surface. Its internal Binder API was reverse-engineered to identify the hidden method
names used to interact with `SurfaceControl`:
`openTransaction`, `setDisplaySurface`, `setDisplayProjection`,
`setDisplayLayerStack`, `closeTransaction`.

DashCast uses the same static `SurfaceControl` API directly, confirming compatibility
with DiLink 3.0.

## Core mechanism

### VirtualDisplay cluster creation — CONFIRMED (03/05/2026)

> Source: live logcat captured on BYD Seal EU (DiLink 3.0, API 29)

**The cluster VirtualDisplay does NOT exist at boot.** It is created on demand by the
following sequence, captured to the millisecond:

```
sendInfo(1000, 30)                  → switch to 12.3" Qt profile (ADAS workaround)
sleep 6s
sendInfo(1000, 16)                  → 全屏投屏开启 — Qt enters projection mode
sleep 6s
sendInfo(1000, 35)                  → Di4.0 mode — triggers VirtualDisplay creation
  │  +132ms  FissionGenerayService (Qt native) handles sendInfo(35)
  │  +219ms  Qt calls getQtProjectionDispInfoNative() via JNI
  │  +251ms  Qt returns: name="fission_bg_xdjaVirtualSurface", bufferProducer ≠ null
  │  +274ms  DisplayManagerService: Display device ADDED
  └  +278ms  AutoDisplayService.createVirtualDisplay() → id=1, 1920×720, FLAG_PRESENTATION
```

The VirtualDisplay is ready **~280ms after sendInfo(35)**. It is owned by
`com.xdja.containerservice` (uid=1000) and has `FLAG_OWN_CONTENT_ONLY`, meaning only its
owner can write to it. Apps are launched on it via `am start --display 1`.

### Cluster activation

```
sendInfo(1000, 30)   → switch the cluster to the Qt surface reserved for 12.3" screens —
                       this fixes the ADAS window layout issue that occurs on 10.25" panels
wait ~1 s
sendInfo(1000, 16)   → Qt standby (全屏投屏开启) — releases the surface for our app
wait ~2 s
am start --display 1 --windowingMode 5 ClusterTrampolineActivity --es target_package <pkg>
```

`sendInfo` is sent via **ADB relay** (uid=2000) because our app (uid=10xxx) is blocked
by `AutoContainerService.checkSendPermissionAndAllowType()`.

### Launching an app on the cluster

`ClusterService` calls `startActivityViaIAM()`, which invokes
`IActivityManager.startActivityAsUser()` via reflection with
`ActivityOptions.setLaunchDisplayId(clusterDisplayId)` set to the cluster display.
This requires `INTERNAL_SYSTEM_WINDOW` — granted because the APK is signed with
`platform.keystore` (AOSP testkey, recognised as the platform cert on this ROM).
A `Context.startActivity()` fallback is used if the IAM call fails.

> `ClusterTrampolineActivity` is still present in the manifest but is not exported
> (`exported="false"`) and its body is a no-op (`finish()` immediately) — kept as
> an emergency fallback only.

### Real-time mirror

```java
// 1. Unlock @hide Android APIs (same mechanism as WindowManagement v1.2)
VMRuntime.setHiddenApiExemptions(["Landroid/", "Lcom/android/", "Ljava/lang/"]);

// 2. Create a virtual mirror display
IBinder token = SurfaceControl.createDisplay("byd_cluster_mirror", true);
// secure=true required on DiLink 3.0 (same as WindowManagement v1.2)

// 3. Project the cluster display onto the TextureView surface
SurfaceControl.openTransaction();
SurfaceControl.setDisplaySurface(token, new Surface(textureView.getSurfaceTexture()));
SurfaceControl.setDisplayLayerStack(token, clusterLayerStack);
SurfaceControl.setDisplayProjection(token, 0, srcRect, dstRect);
SurfaceControl.closeTransaction();
```

### Restore

```
am force-stop <app>                  → releases the Qt surface
sendInfo(1000, 18)                   → 投屏关闭 — close projection
sendInfo(1000, 0)                    → 主机恢复仪表视频流 — Qt resumes
```

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. ADB over network (TCP/IP)

The app communicates with the car via **ADB TCP/IP on port 5555** (localhost, tunneled from the infotainment unit itself). This requires ADB to be enabled on the DiLink system.

On BYD Seal EU (DiLink 3.0), ADB TCP is available at `localhost:5555` from within the infotainment Android environment — no USB cable needed at runtime. The app uses the [dadb](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/dadb) library to connect.

### 2. Platform keystore

The APK must be signed with `platform.keystore` (included in the BYD SDK v1.0.5) to obtain `signature`-level permissions (`INJECT_EVENTS`, `BYDAUTO_*`).

Place it at `app/keystore/platform.keystore` before building.

### 3. BYD SDK

See [Build requirements](#build-requirements) below.

---

## Installation

1. Download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kiroha/byd-dashcast/releases):
   - **Stable**: [v0.1.40-alpha](https://github.com/Kiroha/byd-dashcast/releases/tag/v0.1.40-alpha) — latest tested release
   - **Pre-release**: [v0.1.42-alpha](https://github.com/Kiroha/byd-dashcast/releases/tag/v0.1.42-alpha) — latest code (27 sanity fixes, OTA update feature)
2. Sideload onto the infotainment unit:
```bash
adb connect <car-ip>:5555
# Stable:
adb install -r DashCast-v0.1.40-alpha-debug.apk
# Or pre-release:
adb install -r DashCast-v0.1.42-alpha-debug.apk
```
3. Launch the app. On first launch, an **"Allow USB debugging?"** popup will appear **on the car's screen** — press **ALLOW**.
4. The app should be functional immediately. If permissions are missing, open **⋮ menu → Diagnostic → TEST 1** to force-grant `BYDAUTO_*_COMMON` permissions via `pm grant`.

   > On DiLink 3.0 with `platform.keystore` signing, these permissions are typically pre-granted by the ROM at install time and TEST 1 is not required.

> If you don't have the car's IP, the app can also be installed via USB when ADB USB debugging is enabled (developer options).

---

## Known issues (alpha)

- **Reliability**: The cluster activation sequence may fail on the first attempt — retry
- **Mirror touch (first launch)**: Touch input on the mirror does not work on the very first run. Force-stop the app and relaunch it — touch will work correctly from the second start onwards
- **App persistence**: Apps launched on the cluster may return to the main display after a phone call or ADAS event (Qt reclaims the surface)
- **Split 50/50**: Experimental — may fail depending on target app window mode
- **Language**: The UI has been translated to English, but some messages (toasts, logs) may still appear in French

## Build requirements

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| JDK | 11 (Temurin recommended) |
| Android SDK | API 29 compileSdk, **BYD SDK v1.0.5** as sdk.dir |
| AGP | 7.4.2 |
| Gradle wrapper | 7.6 |

### BYD SDK

This project requires BYD SDK v1.0.5 (modified `android.jar` with `android.hardware.bydauto.*`).

> The SDK is **not included** in this repository (proprietary).  
> Extract to: `../sdk/SDK_v1.0.5/byd-auto_sdk_windows/`  
> Configure `local.properties`:

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/sdk/SDK_v1.0.5/byd-auto_sdk_windows
```

### Signing

The APK must be signed with `platform.keystore` (BYD SDK) for `signature` permissions
(`INJECT_EVENTS`, `BYDAUTO_*_COMMON`).

```
app/keystore/platform.keystore
  alias: androiddebugkey | storepass/keypass: android
```

The `app/build.gradle` signing config applies this keystore for both debug and release.

---

## Build

```bash
cd MyBYDApp   # repo folder name
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK → app/build/outputs/apk/debug/DashCast-v0.1.42-alpha-debug.apk
```

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Type | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `INJECT_EVENTS` | signature | Touch/key injection to the cluster |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | dangerous | Floating overlay (FloatingLogButton) |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | normal | ClusterService |
| `INTERNET` | normal | Network access (reserved for future use) |
| `BYDAUTO_*_COMMON` (×11) | dangerous | BYD vehicle APIs (declared, not yet used) |
| `BYDAUTO_*_GET` | signature | Extended read (not grantable without real BYD key) |

`dangerous` permissions are granted via `pm grant` on first launch (TEST 1 — Diagnostic).

---

## AutoContainer service (cluster)

- Binder: `ServiceManager.getService("AutoContainer")`
- Transaction `#2` = `sendInfo(int type, int infoInt, String infoStr)`
- ADB relay: `service call AutoContainer 2 i32 1000 i32 <cmd> s16 ""`

### Projection control

| cmd | Action | Confirmed |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 16 | Qt standby — releases the cluster surface for our app (全屏投屏开启) | ✅ 16/04/2026 |
| 18 | Close projection — re-enables Qt stream (投屏关闭) | ✅ 16/04/2026 |
| 0  | Refresh Qt video stream — Qt resumes (主机恢复仪表视频流) | ✅ |
| 1  | **⛔ DO NOT USE** — disconnects Qt entirely (destroys display 1) | — |

### Cluster display size

The instrument cluster size mode must be set before launching any app.
The Seal EU has a **10.25" physical screen** (cmd 31), but this mode causes ADAS widget
stretching. Using cmd 30 (12.3" Seal U-DMI rounded screen profile) fixes the aspect ratio.

| cmd | Screen size | Model | Notes |
|-----|------------|-------|-------|
| 29  | 8.8"  | BYD Atto 3 | — |
| 30  | 12.3" | BYD Seal U-DMI (rounded cluster) | **Use this on Seal EU** — fixes ADAS stretching |
| 31  | 10.25" | BYD Seal EU | Native size but causes ADAS window distortion |

```bash
# Force 12.3" mode (recommended for Seal EU):
adb shell service call AutoContainer 2 i32 1000 i32 30 s16 ""
```

> This command is sent automatically at the start of the cluster activation sequence (`sendInfo(1000, 30)`).
> Use **TEST 3** in DiagActivity to cycle through sizes manually.

## Field diagnostic

1. **TEST 1** → ADB connection + `pm grant` `_COMMON` permissions
2. **TEST 2** → cluster restore (sendInfo 30→16→18→0)
3. **TEST 3** → cluster display size change (cmd 29/30/31)
4. **TEST 4** → MirrorDaemon: scan / kill / kill+restart / export logs / SurfaceFlinger dump
5. **TEST 5** → Sniffer: scan / start / stop / export logcat report / clean logs
6. **TEST 6** → Cluster orientation: freeze LANDSCAPE/PORTRAIT / unfreeze / read rotation (`IWindowManager.freezeDisplayRotation` — no `wm size`)
7. **TEST 7** → DiLink5 resize test: `WM:4→5` + `resizeTask(RESIZE_MODE_FORCED=3)` via raw Binder + task inspection

### Retrieve logs without USB cable

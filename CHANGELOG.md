## Pre-releases

| Version | versionCode | Summary |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **0.5.1** | 78 | **Release**: Out of beta! Comprehensive i18n support localized hardcoded strings across UI, overscan layouts, and system Toasts in all 12 supported languages. Fixed missing "Adjust" button from the manual UI diagram. |
| **0.4.3-alpha** | 73 | **Enhancement / Fix**: Removed Native Library extraction (\`extractNativeLibs=false\`) to drastically reduce install time and zero-out duplicate storage load. Corrected the URI Share Permission flags across all FileProvider Intents so Logs and Sniffers export successfully without crashing the OS. |
| **0.4.2-alpha** | 72 | **Critical BugFix**: Re-engineered ADB Task Identifier extractor using \`awk\` pattern matching to properly correlate BYD's multiline \`dumpsys\` outputs, ensuring the Red Cross accurately finds and removes orphaned Tasks in the Recents pool. |
| **0.4.1-alpha** | 71 | **Revert**: The red-cross kill button no longer drops the cluster projection. It only stops the app memory process, leaving the cluster display ready (black screen) for a new app cast without needing to restart the whole projection layer. |
| **0.4.0-alpha** | 70 | **Critical BugFix**: Resolved the red-cross force-stop on DiLink 3.0 via strict `app_process64` syntax. When killing an app currently running, DashCast will now automatically release the cluster and return back to the standard BYD Speedometer to prevent the black frozen screen illusion. |
| **0.3.3-alpha** | 69 | **Fix**: Corrected ADB kill app action (`TaskRemover` headless invocation syntax) and made mirror dynamic \`Apply\` button utilize \`wm overscan\` like the settings. |
| **0.3.2-alpha** | 68 | **Diag: ADAS Toggle** — Added two direct ADB buttons in the Diag tool to manually and easily send `sendInfo(1000, 47)` (ON) and `sendInfo(1000, 48)` (OFF) to toggle BYD's secret ADAS debugging mode on the cluster. |
| **0.3.1-alpha** | 67 | **Optimisation: Elegant App Killer** — Replaced the blind Binder sequence (service call 23/24) with a custom headless Java process (TaskRemover). DashCast now uses Android's native reflection inside an ADB shell to gracefully and accurately find the correct removeTask function regardless of the DiLink version or OEM tweaks. |
| **0.3.0-alpha** | 66 | **Feature: Per-App Resizing!** — You can now save individual Horizontal & Vertical inset values for each application separately using quick-access sliders directly accessible under the Mirror preview panel in DashCast, while the target app is running! (No more global resizing conflicts between Media and Navigation apps) |
| **0.2.95-alpha** | 65 | **Hotfix 5: Ghost Apps in Recents (Android 10/DiLink 3.0)** — Fixed the regex matching for ADB task removal. DashCast now successfully identifies and removes the active Task ID from the App Manager (Recents) so DiLink no longer mistakenly considers the app as running in the background after clicking the Red Cross. |
| **0.2.94-alpha** | 64 | **Hotfix 4: Kill Button Behavior** — Fixed an issue where terminating the active app with the red cross also stopped the ClusterService projection engine. The VirtualDisplay is now left intact when killing an app, allowing the user to seamlessly launch another app to the dashboard without needing to re-activate the engine. Note: Original fix failed injection sync. |
| **0.2.93-alpha** | 63 | **Hotfix 3: Kill Button Behavior** — Fixed an issue where terminating the active app with the red cross also stopped the ClusterService projection engine. The VirtualDisplay is now left intact when killing an app, allowing the user to seamlessly launch another app to the dashboard without needing to re-activate the engine. |
| **0.2.92-alpha** | 62 | **Hotfix 2: Android 10 am task compatibility** — Further fallbacks added to delete the ghost tasks in Android UI. Attempts `am task rm`, `am stack remove` or a low-level Binder call `service call activity 23` depending on ROM customizations. Warnings suppressed to allow the final `am force-stop` to execute cleanly. |
| **0.2.91-alpha** | 61 | **Hotfix: Android 10 am task compatibility** — Replaced `am task rm` with the formally valid `am task remove` command to ensure the Recents UI ghostly task is successfully deleted before `am force-stop`. |
| **0.2.9-alpha** | 60 | **Process & Task Killer** — Fixed an issue where terminating an app with the red cross only killed its background processes but left it in the 'Recent Apps' overview. ADB now identifies `TaskRecord` IDs and executes `am task rm` to fully clear them from Recents UI before issuing `force-stop`. |
| **0.2.8-alpha** | 59 | **Interactive OTA UI** — Enhanced the Over-The-Air updater. Users are now presented with a dialog displaying the full changelog natively fetched from GitHub releases. Added explicit 'Update Now' vs 'Update Later' choices rather than forced auto-download. |
| **0.2.7-alpha** | 58 | **Auto-Launch Checkbox Fix** — Restored visibility and binding logic for the 'Auto' checkbox in the list/grid views. |
| **0.2.6-alpha** | 57 | **Floating Button Fix** — Fixed Smart Overlay Button spawn bug (immediate transparency and off-screen misplacement). Elevated opacity and timing logic to restore correct visibility sync. |
| **0.2.5-alpha** | 56 | **Dark Text Fix** — Grid mode app labels corrected to Dark Gray for visibility against light backgrounds. Duplicate checkbox fixed. |
| **0.2.4-alpha** | 55 | **Auto-Launch & Grid View** — Implemented 5-column Grid layout. Added Boot Auto-Launch exclusivity (Radio behavior) and "Favorites" persistence via Long-Press. |
| **0.2.3-alpha** | 54 | **QoL UI Update** — Removed Split-screen logic. Added Top Overflow menu with List/Grid toggle switch. Persistent state management via SharedPreferences. |
